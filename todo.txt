- Rasterizer
    - Guard Band clipping - otherwise we need to clip every triangle intersecting l/r/t/b planes.
    - Optimize triangle/pixel setup variables - a bunch of redundant work currently

- Overall pipeline
    - Slowly transition testing/learning rasterizer code into a more unified pipeline
    - Support pixel/vertex shading
    - Multithreading
    - Expose some control of renderer/rasterizer state.
        - Blending
        - Scissor
        - Depth test
    - Tiled framebuffer/depth buffer
    - HI-Z
    - Tiled textures (investigate Z-order/Morton as a stretch?)

- Shading 
    - Simple lambert/specular shading pipeline
    - Lighting (spot, point, directional)
    - Shadow mapping?
    - PBR (eg GGX)

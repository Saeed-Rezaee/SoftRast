- Front end
    - Vectorize binning/triangle setup

- Rasterizer
    - Guard Band clipping - otherwise we need to clip every triangle intersecting l/r/t/b planes.

- Overall pipeline
    - Support vertex shading (or atleast converting integer attributes to floating point)
    - Expose some control of renderer/rasterizer state.
        - Blending
        - Scissor
        - Depth test
    - HI-Z

- Shading 
    - Simple lambert/specular shading pipeline (blinn-phong?)
    - Lighting (spot, point, directional)
    - Shadow mapping?

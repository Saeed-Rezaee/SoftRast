Rasterizer
    - Guard Band clipping - otherwise we need to clip every triangle intersecting l/r/t/b planes.
    - Optimize triangle/pixel setup variables - a bunch of redundant work currently

- Overall pipeline
    - Slowly transition testing/learning rasterizer code into a more unified pipeleine
    - Support pixel/vertex shading
    - Multithreading
    - Expose some control of renderer/rasterizer state. Eg blending, scissor etc


- Shading 
    - Simple lambert/specular shading pipeline
    - Lighting (spot, point, directional)
    - Shadow mapping?
    - PBR (eg GGX)

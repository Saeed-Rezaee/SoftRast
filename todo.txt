Comment the code :)

- Front end
    - Vectorize binning/triangle setup
    - Guard Band clipping - otherwise we need to clip every triangle intersecting l/r/t/b planes.

- Rasterizer
    - Expose some control of rasterizer state.
        - Blending
        - Scissor
        - Depth test

- Overall pipeline
    - Support vertex shading (or atleast converting integer attributes to floating point)
    - HI-Z
    - Fast clear for depth + color
    - Double buffer or pipeline the blitting. Looks like we could save a couple of ms very easily here.

- Shading 
    - Simple lambert/specular shading pipeline (blinn-phong?)
    - Lighting (spot, point, directional)
    - Shadow mapping?
